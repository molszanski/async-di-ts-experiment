# Intro

Iti is 1kB Typesafe dependency injection framework for TypeScript and JavaScript with a unique support for **async flow**

_This library doesn't try be scientifically correct. I just want to go home early_

## Features

- **supports async(!) dependencies:** merges async code and constructor injection via plain **async** functions

- **strongly typed:** has great IDE autocomplete and compile time check. Without any [manual type casting](https://github.com/inversify/InversifyJS/blob/master/wiki/container_api.md#containergettserviceidentifier-interfacesserviceidentifiert-t)
- **non-invasive:** does not require imported `@decorators` or framework `extends` in your application business logic
- **lazy:** initialises your app modules and containers on demand
- **split chunks:** enables **[dynamic imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#dynamic_imports)** via a [one liner](#dynamic-imports) thanks to a fully async core
- **React friendly:** has useful **[React](https://github.com/molszanski/iti/tree/master/iti-react)** bindings to help you separate application business logic and a React view layer
- **starter friendly:** works with starters like [Create React App](https://create-React-app.dev/) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) unlike existing libraries
- **no Babel config:** doesn't require `reflect-metadata` or decorators so there is no need to hack in decorator and `"decoratorMetadata"` support in to your build configs
- **tiny:** less than 1kB

IoC is an amazing pattern and it should **easy to adopt**, fully support async and without hard to learn APIs or complex tooling requirements.

Iti relies on plain JS functions, objects and familiar patterns. API is simple so you can make a **proof of concept integration in minutes**.

It is an alternative to [InversifyJS](https://github.com/inversify/InversifyJS) and [microsoft/tsyringe](https://github.com/microsoft/tsyringe) for constructor injection.

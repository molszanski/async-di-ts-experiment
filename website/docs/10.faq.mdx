## Questions

### Why should I use ITI?

We strongly belive that helps to implement good DI patterns in your codebase and offers
better tradeoffs compared to alternative DI frameworks or solutions.
Check our [alternatives](/docs/alternatives) section

### How does handle circular dependency?

You can not create a circular dependency with iti and typescript.
It will throw a typescript error if you try :)

<CodeBlock language="ts">{circularDependency}</CodeBlock>
